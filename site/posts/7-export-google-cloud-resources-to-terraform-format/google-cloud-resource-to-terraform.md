Typically, during the initial stages of development, we often establish our operational infrastructure on Google Cloud through ClickOps. This setup currently serves as our production environment, but our goal is to transition it to Infrastructure as Code (IAC) in the future.

## So how can one migrate from ClickOps to IAC for google cloud

Well we already have a command line utility for this, read more about it [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/resource-management/export#before-you-begin)

## Not a fan of documentation? here are the steps to follow

 ### 1. Authenticate with GCP and configure the target project.
  
```
> gcloud auth login

> gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```
 ### 2.  Install GCP's config-connector.

```
> gcloud components install config-connector
```

 ### 3. Now run the below command to start exporting your infrastructure, replace the output path and your project ID
  
```
> gcloud beta resource-config bulk-export \
 --path=OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_PATH \
 --project=PROJECT_ID \
 --resource-format=terraform
```

The export is arranged in the format:

> OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/projects/PROJECT_ID/RESOURCE_TYPE

For most of you, we are done here ðŸŽ‰ . But for others who want to optimize their export.

## Nerd Alert

To get list of resources that can be exported using bulk-export command run [list-resource-types](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/resource-config/list-resource-types)

```
> gcloud beta resource-config list-resource-types
```

Now using the list you can selectively import only the required ones using [--resource-types=](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/resource-management/export#export_a_single_resource_type) flag
