Right after i developed my first application, next thing that i wanted to do was deploy it on cloud to share it with others.
While there are many tools available like [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) etc to deploy your app easily without much setup, 
i always want to know what it takes to deploy a app from start on a cloud service provider like GKE or AWS.

This blog will cover one of the steps which is to create a deployment of your app using kubernetes, 
test it locally on minikube to be ready to deploy on a cloud service like GKE or AWS with minimal or no changes.

## Prequisite
* [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
* [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
* A docker image of your app you want to deploy

assuming you have a react app your docker file would looks something like this
<br/>
![docker file](https://res.cloudinary.com/jenishjain/image/upload/v1651933832/portfolio/blog-assets/react_dockerfile.png)
<br/>
Note, that exposing the port is quite important since thatâ€™s where the application will run.
<br/>
Now that we have a docker file ready we would need to build this docker image
and transfer it to docker hub, post which we can specify this image path in our
kubernetes deployment files
