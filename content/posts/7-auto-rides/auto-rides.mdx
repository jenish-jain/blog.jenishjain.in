After all who want's to read about tech always. so here you go. one blog and hopefully one only for sometime dedicated to some of the crazy auto rides i have been into.

## Ride from bullet train to home [2022-08-07]


It was me and my roommate at bangalore who were heading out to our room after watching a nice [movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12593682/). Since we didn't had any vehicles ourself we tried booking an auto, clueless were we that our auto ride was gonna be equally fun as well.

What would you expect from a usual cab/ auto driver ask for your OTP and then get on a call with one of their friends for rest of their rides else talk with you about life and politics leaving you thinking about what are you doing with yout life. But this was different to start with right after he arrived before asking for OTP he grabbed the etal frame of his auto over his head did a weird pullup while still sitting probably to stretch out his body , took out OTP started the ride and their we go. I believe he should be a having some wrist problem else why would someone always start a ride with a straight 90 degree wrist movement throttling to a max he could no mattere if we were in a empty lane or a traffic stuck road, everytime he stopped the auto due to traffic lights or traffic we knew after the first time we better grab something now to prevent the jerk. Also strangly he was so skilled at driving his auto he could pass within lanes on car leaving less space than visually his auto could fit inn. Me and my roommate where constantly looking out for him to hit someone 

crazy riding
sai baba on brige
fearing walkers on street
honking person on red light (what is this action)
me nd my roommate looking at each other to make out to home alive
weard habit of jumping from the seat and holding the bars on top
selecting songs, sending messages and watching tiktock all while driving
